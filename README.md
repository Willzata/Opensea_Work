##This work allows the scraping of NFT work from the website Opensea.io

##After scraping Images, they are processed and their filepaths are saved, along with various bits of metadata, to a SQLite database.

##A vector embedding library is used to create image similarity vectors for each image, which can then be used to identify other similar images.
